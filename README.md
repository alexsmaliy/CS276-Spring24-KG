This repo contains code and materials for preparing data to be used
with [Graph2Seq-for-KGQG-Rewrite](https://github.com/alexsmaliy/Graph2Seq-for-KGQG-Rewrite).

Specifically, the Jupyter notebook included here operates over XML dumps
produced by the Intelligent Notebooks model generation service. Several
of these XML dumps are checked in here.

For convenience, a Python pickled archive of a subset of WikiData Knowledge Graph
triples is included as well, as this scrape can be time-consuming.

A sample output in JSON lines format (JSON objects, one per line) is also provided.
